Applied Math Project where we analyse Time Series Data using ARIMA, Regressive, Exponential Smoothing, DeepLearning Techniques to predict the data and automated the prediction process for any cluster.
We also performed image processing techniques in the image provided "a4.png" and tried GMM clustering of the blobs.
